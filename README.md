## Overview

The NeoWs API provides near earth Asteroid information. It is useful for anyone curious about astronomical happenings. I use the API to generate a visualization showing how many potentially hazardous asteroids are present each month in a given date range and produce some statistics comparing potentially and non-potentially hazardous asteroids.

## Results

**Example Date Range**: 2019-01-01 to 2019-05-31

**Average Asteroid Stats**

Potentially Hazardous | Relative Velocity (MPH) | Miss Distance (Miles) | Estimated Max Diameter (Feet)
--- | --- | --- | ---
No | 28,229 | 18,744,136 | 849
Yes | 37,816 | 24,667,155 | 2,122
